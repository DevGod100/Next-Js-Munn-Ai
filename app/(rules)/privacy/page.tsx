          our net profits to be shared among all the contributors whose images

        </p>

        <p className="font-bold py-4">Beta Stage Notice:</p>
        <p>
          We want to keep you informed that we are currently in the beta stage
          of our platform. During this time, we are continuously improving and
          enhancing the BillionPic Platform.

        <h1 className="font-bold py-4">Payouts Delay:</h1>
        <p>
          At this moment, we do not have the dashboard ready for tracking the

          are temporarily delayed. We anticipate that this phase will take
          approximately 3-6 months to complete. Please note that payout timing
          is at the company's discretion.
